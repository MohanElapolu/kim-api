/**
\mainpage Introduction

The %KIM API package is a system-level library that aims to give computer
programmers the ability to write atomistic or molecular simulation programs
that can seamlessly interface (in a plug-and-play manner) with independent
implementations of interatomic models, regardless of the programming language
(C, C++, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95/2003, Python, etc.) in which the codes are
written.

The %KIM API defines standard quantities that must be communicated between the
simulation code and the interatomic model, such as the number of particles, the
species and position coordinates of each particle, and the forces acting on the
particles.  This information is communicated via memory pointers so that
minimal data copying is necessary.  The %KIM API provides a "model object" and
"compute-arguments object" interface which facilitates and simplifies (as much
as possible) the exchange of memory pointers between the simulator and model.

This documentation is organized into the following components:

-# \ref features

-# \ref theory

-# \ref implementation

-# Example simulators written in C++ (\ref ex_test_Ar_fcc_cluster_cpp.cpp), C
   (\ref ex_test_Ar_fcc_cluster.c), and Fortran
   (\ref ex_test_Ar_fcc_cluster_fortran.f90).

-# Example stand-alone models written in C++ (\ref LennardJones_Ar.cpp), C
   (\ref ex_model_Ar_P_Morse_07C.c, ex_model_Ar_P_Morse_MultiCutoff.c) and
   Fortran (\ref ex_model_Ar_P_MLJ_Fortran.f90,
   ex_model_Ar_SLJ_MultiCutoff.f90)

-# Example model drivers written in C++
   (LennardJones612Implementation.hpp), C (ex_model_driver_P_Morse.c),
   and Fortran (ex_model_driver_P_LJ.f90).

-# Example parameterized models (ex_model_Ar_P_LJ.params,
   ex_model_Ar_P_Morse.params, LennardJones612_UniversalShifted.params)

-# \ref version2_differences

In addition, all public header files and included example codes are available
for [browsing](files.html).
