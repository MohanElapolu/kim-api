/**
\mainpage Table of Contents

The Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (%KIM) Application Programming
Interface (API) defines a standard for how molecular simulators interface with
interatomic models (also called potentials or force-fields).  This allows a
single computer implementation of a model to be used (without modification)
within multiple simulator codes.  See [openkim.org](https://openkim.org) to
find hundreds of model implementations,
[openkim.org/projects-using-kim](https://openkim.org/projects-using-kim) to
learn which simulators support the %KIM API, and
[openkim.org/kim-api](https://openkim.org/kim-api) to learn how to use %KIM
models with those simulators.

This documentation describes the specifications and official implementation of
the %KIM API as a system-level software library that gives computer programmers
the ability to write models and/or simulators in supported programming language
(C, C++, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95/2003).

Table of Contents:

-# \ref features

-# \ref theory

-# \ref implementation

-# Example simulators written in C++ (\ref ex_test_Ar_fcc_cluster_cpp.cpp), C
   (\ref ex_test_Ar_fcc_cluster.c), and Fortran
   (\ref ex_test_Ar_fcc_cluster_fortran.f90).

-# Example stand-alone models written in C++ (\ref LennardJones_Ar.cpp), C
   (\ref ex_model_Ar_P_Morse_07C.c, ex_model_Ar_P_Morse_MultiCutoff.c,
   ex_model_Ar_P_Morse_07C_w_Extensions.c) and Fortran (\ref
   ex_model_Ar_P_MLJ_Fortran.f90, ex_model_Ar_SLJ_MultiCutoff.f90)

-# Example model drivers written in C++
   (LennardJones612Implementation.hpp), C (ex_model_driver_P_Morse.c),
   and Fortran (ex_model_driver_P_LJ.f90).

-# Example parameterized models (ex_model_Ar_P_LJ.params,
   ex_model_Ar_P_Morse.params, LennardJones612_UniversalShifted.params)

-# \ref version2_differences

In addition, all public header files and included example codes are available
for [browsing](files.html).
