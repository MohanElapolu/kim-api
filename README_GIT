The kim-api git repository comes with a set of git-hooks that should be enabled
once the repo has been cloned locally.  A script is provided to do just this:

$ ./scripts/configure-git-repo-hooks-etc


Two other scripts are provided:

* create-package

  This script is only for use by the package maintainer and is used to generate
  a release commit and the corresponding official release tarball.

* clang-format-all

  This script will format all the c/c++ code in the repo using the clang-format
  utility.  clang-format is assumed to be installed on the system and in the
  path.  The ./git-hooks/pre-commit hook also depends on the availability of
  clang-format.
