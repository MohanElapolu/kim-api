============================= The KIM API package =============================

The KIM API package is a system-level library that aims to give computer
programmers the ability to write atomistic or molecular simulation programs
that can seamlessly interface with implementations of interatomic models,
regardless of the programming language (C, C++, Fortran, Python, etc.) in which
the codes are written.  It is part of the larger KIM project
(https://openkim.org).


See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to build and install the package
and its documentation.
